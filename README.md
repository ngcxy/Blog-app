# Blog-app
My website of the blog app: ~~[https://xinyi-blog-backend-d2d1d1896e7c.herokuapp.com/](https://xinyi-blog-frontend-19d2ab0c45dd.herokuapp.com)~~

!! This link is no longer available due to Heroku's removing the free plan.

I'm now deploying it on Vercel: [the Blog app](https://my-blog-app-silk.vercel.app/)
Sometimes the website might encounter CORS problems due to platform's status.

Display on localhost is available.
